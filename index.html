                    looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
                    amazing experience here. I singed up for the free intro course and
                    found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                    completing the course. I've successfully switched careers, working

                    needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                    program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                    were very hands-on I never had to long for assistance. The agile
                    team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took ny learning to
                    the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact,
                    I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                    development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
